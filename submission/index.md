# Paper and Demo Submission

* **Papers**: Full papers (12-15 + pages, overall length including references) and short papers (6-11 pages) formatted in [LNCS style](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines) (Template:    [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/springer-lecture-notes-in-computer-science/kzwwpvhwnvfj), [Microsoft Word](https://resource-cms.springernature.com/springer-cms/rest/v1/content/19238706/data/v1)). Refer to [Instructions for Authors](https://resource-cms.springernature.com/springer-cms/rest/v1/content/19242230/data/).
* **Software Demos**: During paper submissions, you can apply for presenting an on-site software demo.
* **Submission Portal**: [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/SHAPEMI2024](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/SHAPEMI2024)
* **Review**: The review is single-blind (submissions should include authors and affiliations). Reviewers will be chosen among experts in the medical image computing community.
* **Presentations**: The most original contributions will be selected for oral presentation; all contributions will be asked for a poster presentation, including a short 1-1.5 min video.

In contrast to previous years, the conference will be held exclusively in person due to possible internet restrictions. 
The program will comprise keynote speakers and presentations of the accepted papers, delivered in either oral or poster format.
In the event that the scheduled keynote speakers are unable to attend due to visa or illness-related issues, a pre-recorded video will be utilized as a substitute. 
All presenters are required to submit their full presentation slides to the organizers prior to the workshop for on-site distribution.
Following the presentation, the session's chair will facilitate a brief live discussion. 
Additionally, authors are requested to create a concise video showcasing their posters, which will be displayed on-site and subsequently featured on our website.

* **Proceedings**: We plan on publishing the workshop proceedings in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). We may not be able to include abstracts in the proceedings. 

Please note that at least one co-author **must register** for the workshop by the early bird registration deadline **August 25, 2024**.
